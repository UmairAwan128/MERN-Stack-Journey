# MERN-Stack-Journey
These are the exercises and Projects, I completed while learning Javascript and MERN Stack technologies i.e MongoDB, Express, React and Node.


# MOOC Used
These exercises and projects are part of multiple courses from Mosh Hamedani on [CodeWithMosh](https://codewithmosh.com/courses) and from Youtube. Also my [Final Year Project](https://github.com/UmairAwan128/MERN-CRUD-Generator) was in MERN Stack.

# Projects
Some of the important projects that I built during the journey.
- **MERN-CRUD-Generator** It was my Final Year Project. The project is a node application that takes json schema as input and generate a corresponding React CRUD Application, Express API's and Database in MongoDB. You can see it [here](https://github.com/UmairAwan128/MERN-CRUD-Generator).

- **Vidly Project** which is a complete Movies management application built over the MERN Stack technologies following the Industry Standards. You can see it [here](https://github.com/UmairAwan128/MERN-Stack-Journey/tree/main/Projects/Vidly).

- **Counter React App** which is a simple Counter Management application built using React. You can see it [here](https://github.com/UmairAwan128/MERN-Stack-Journey/tree/main/Projects/counter-react-app).
